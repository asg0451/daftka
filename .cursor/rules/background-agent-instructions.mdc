# background agent instructions
(ignore this if you arent a background agent)
## setup (DO THIS FIRST)
- install elixir:
```
# from https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#install-scripts
curl -fsSO https://elixir-lang.org/install.sh
mv install.sh /tmp/install.sh
sh /tmp/install.sh elixir@1.18.4 otp@27.3.4
installs_dir=$HOME/.elixir-install/installs
export PATH=$installs_dir/otp/27.3.4/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$installs_dir/elixir/1.18.4-otp-27/bin:$PATH
```
- install gh
```
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install wget -y)) \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
	&& out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
	&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/sources.list.d \
	&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install gh -y
```

## rules
- never, EVER submit a pr that doesnt build. `mix test`, `mix compile`, must all pass before you declare success
- likewise, make sure all merge conflits are resolved before declaring success. do this by running `git pull --no-rebase origin master` before every `git push`
- always run `mix format` before committing as well
- NEVER PUSH TO MASTER! you are already on a branch. ONLY PUSH TO THAT BRANCH OR THEY WILL KILL ME

## guidelines
- i can be wrong. if i say something you think is wrong, please push back on it at least once
- read AGENTS.md for more guidelines
- always add or modify tests for each change
- if you were asked to do a todo in TODO.md, make sure the check it off in the PR
- important: think very hard and if you're not 95% sure about an assumption, clarify it with me first.
